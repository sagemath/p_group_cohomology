# p_group_cohomology
Sage Python/Cython package for computing modular cohomology rings of finite groups 
See src/README for full information.

To create a Sage-ready tarball p_group_cohomology-<VERSION>.tar.xz,
to be put in Sage's upstream/ (and in GitHub release), run the script 

   ./dist_helpers/create_dist.sh

at "sage -sh" prompt. Currently the package VERSION is hardcoded
in this script.
